## Beauty of Randomness - heatmaps

### What is a heatmap?

Heatmaps are prevalently used in biological studies to visualize data in a grid.   
The colors in heatmaps represent numbers, so they provide an easy way to quickly visualize a lot of numbers at the same time. 

> A heat map (or heatmap) is a data visualization technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions.    
> "Heat map" is a relatively new term, but the practice of shading matrices has existed for over a century. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map)

### Heatmap as art...?

Could a heat map be considered art?   
Well, if you are looking at heatmaps from the view of a fiber artist, they might appear as artist combinations of color blocks, similar to textile constructions somehow.  
   
In this project, I used Python to randomly generate a matrix of numbers and visualized them as heatmaps.   
The images generated by the program could provide aesthetic pleasure and emphasize the resemblance between science and art.

## Minimal python code needed for this project:
### First things first - let's import some useful python libraries!
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
```
### Then, roll dices for a 30 by 30 matrix to generate random numbers.
```
data = np.random.randn(30, 30)
```

### Finally, pick a color map to make the plot.
```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,15))
ax.axis('off')
plt.imshow(data, cmap='YlOrBr')
```

```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,15))
ax.axis('off')
plt.imshow(data, cmap='Spectral')
```

```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,15))
ax.axis('off')
plt.imshow(data, cmap='PiYG')
```
