## About

**This website displays my sciart creations and provides instruction for anyone interested in re-creating them.**

Integrating my knowledge in coding and in data visualization with storytelling skills,   
this sciart project hopefully sparks more interest in science,   
brings more attention to biological stories, and entertains the public.
