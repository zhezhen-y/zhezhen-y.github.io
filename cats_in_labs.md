## What if cats rule the labs?

Have you ever wondered what would it be like if cats wear lab coats, perform experiments, and do research? 

With the help of [stable diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com), I was able to create some interesting images under that theme.

*(Click [here](stable_diffusion_demo.md) for a quick guide to Stable Diffusion Online!)*  

Below are some examples of the prompts I used:

```
a cat knocking down a box of chemical reagent in a lab
cat drinking coffee in an office
cat with glasses in front of a computer in an office
```
Stable diffusion has returned me some very funny pictures.  
Some are quite convincing; some will need more touches.

### I bet receiving packages would be one of their favorite moments...
