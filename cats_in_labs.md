## What if cats rule the labs?

**Project description:**   

Have you ever wondered what would it be like if cats wear lab coats, perform experiments, and do research? 

With the help of [stable diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com), I was able to create some interesting images.

Those are some examples of the keywords I entered in the prompt:

```
a cat knocking down a box of chemical reagent
cat drinking coffee in an office
cat with glasses in front of a computer in an office
```
## Reveal time...!
