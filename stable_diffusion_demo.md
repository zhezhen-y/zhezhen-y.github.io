## What is Stable Diffusion?

In short, Stable Diffusion is a free AI tool that generates images from text descriptions.  
The best thing about it?    
No prior knowledge in coding is required to use it!

> Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022.   
> The Stable Diffusion model supports the ability to generate new images from scratch through the use of a text prompt describing elements to be included or omitted from the output.   
> The text to image sampling script within Stable Diffusion, known as "txt2img", consumes a text prompt in addition to assorted option parameters covering sampling types, output image dimensions, and seed values. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)


## Quick guide to use Stable Diffusion Online under 5 min!

### Step 1. Open the website in your browser.

Click this [link](https://stablediffusionweb.com) to open Stable Diffusion web interface.

### Step 2. Enter your prompt.

Scroll down and you will see **"Stable Diffusion Playground"**.  

Come up with your text descriptions for an image (which is called a *"prompt"*).

Enter your prompt.

Below are some examples of the prompts I used:

```
cell in minimalism style
molecular biology in impressionism style
```

You can also start with their examples:

```

```

### Step 3. The last step: click "Generate image" button! 
   
Below are the images I got on Stable Diffusion Online:  

**Usually you will get four images.**

**Sometimes you get less than four:**
